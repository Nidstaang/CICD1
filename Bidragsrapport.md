Tackling this project alone has been challenging but I have learnt so much in so little time. I have started feeling more confident and prone to just keep trying and do not give up. Working hands on has really been a good experience that has made me like more what I am studying as I was able to make things actually work.

The project I have developed is divided in two main things: a game and a website. The game covers the CI part with the CircleCI pipeline, and the testing and the website is where the CD happens, as the new versions of the game are deployed automatically to the website. 

As I have not had a lot of time to dive deep into testing the tests that I have implemented are very basic ones (2+2 type of tests). I plan on diving a bit deeper into this and write better tests when I have learned more but for example, I had no idea on how to write testing for a function that only prints. I have not found relevant information on the internet or on any documentation and due to the short time I had to do this project I did not have enough time to bother any teachers with questions. 
I understand, though, that in real life testing is important, as any little change that one makes in a document can make everything crash. 
It felt very good to understand a bit more about CircleCI and I find it is such a powerful tool and so easy to work with. I was very happy we learnt about it and I could use it in this project. 

When it comes to version control I have been updating the code and the files mosty from Visual Studio Code, although I have done pull requests and some merging and organising manually via the github website.

I only used one pipeline to test the code and check after every update that everything worked. 
It was a very basic pipeline that build a docker container with python and then run a lint and the test file in the game code. 
The CD pipeline checked that the game was properly deployed but, once again, the lack of time made it a bit difficult to make it work as well as I wanted. 


The organisation of the requirements was easy as there was only one person doing it (me) and I did not have to plan a lot or discuss with anyone when it came to changes or updates of the requirements or what I wanted to do. 
Because there are many local files and I did not use Azure and I could work with the trial versions, there is no cost for the project.

When it comes to difficulties I have encountered, I would say that the biggest ones were the lack of time and knowledge. The time one is pretty self-explanatory so I will focus more on the knowledge issue. 
I have had both normal and very stupid issues. I got stuck for days trying to make the commit/push thing work on Visual Studio to find that the only problem was that I was trying to do that from the wrong directory. 
Then I spend a lot of time trying to make the CI pipeline work to realize that I had written an extra space in the .yml file and that is why it did not work.
It took me some time as well to think of how I wanted to automate the delivery but then the solution just popped in my mind one evening and from there it was very easy to build the necessary things. 
Finally, I felt that in general I did not have enough knowledge to do this but after reading zillions of documentation files and watching the classes and many youtube tutorials I kind of managed. 

As I have not used Azure DevOps there is no branch policies implemented although I find it is a very useful tool (specially for people that might be not so skilled, like myself. For example I miss-clicked once when trying to push my code and I deleted half my project files). Branch policies limit the kind of changes you can make to a branch as well as limiting the contributors to the branch. It is a way to protect and secure the code that exists in the branch. 

The project is not finished in the sense that the game is in constant development as it is a personal project of mine, but I would like to think that it has enough so far to comply with the requirements for this project. I am happy with the work I have done as I feel I have been quite resourceful and found my way through all the difficulties (sometimes with external help, sometimes with endless trial and error). 

In conclusion, I feel this project has helped me a lot to build confidence, better my skills in basically everything we have learnt through the year and teached me to not give up and always try to find a solution to a problem (or a way around it). I wish I could have tried to do this in group as in real life scenarios it is how work is done most of the time but at the same time, I liked having to fix everything by myself and not relying in anyone.
