Inledning


Tackling this project alone has been challenging but I have learnt so much in so little time. I have started feeling more confident and prone to just keep trying and do not give up. Working hands on has really been a good experience that has made me like more what I am studying as I was able to make things actually work.

The project I have developed is divided in two main things: a game and a website. The game covers the CI part with the CircleCI pipeline, and the testing and the website is where the CD happens, as the new versions of the game are deployed automatically to the website. 

As I have not had a lot of time to dive deep into testing the tests that I have implemented are very basic ones (2+2 type of tests). I plan on diving a bit deeper into this and write better tests when I have learned more but for example, I had no idea on how to write testing for a function that only prints. I have not found relevant information on the internet or on any documentation and due to the short time I had to do this project I did not have enough time to bother any teachers with questions. 
I understand, though, that in real life testing is important, as any little change that one makes in a document can make everything crash. 
It felt very good to understand a bit more about CircleCI and I find it is such a powerful tool and so easy to work with. I was very happy we learnt about it and I could use it in this project. 

When it comes to version control I have been updating the code and the files mosty from Visual Studio Code, although I have done pull requests and some merging and organising manually via the github website.

I only used one pipeline to test the code and check after every update that everything worked. 
It was a very basic pipeline that build a docker container with python and then run a lint and the test file in the game code. 
The CD pipeline checked that the game was properly deployed but, once again, the lack of time made it a bit difficult to make it work as well as I wanted. 


The organisation of the requirements was easy as there was only one person doing it (me) and I did not have to plan a lot or discuss with anyone when it came to changes or updates of the requirements or what I wanted to do.
