Report – Inlämningsuppgift 1
Both my exercises are tied to the final project. Thus, in both reports there may be things that are repeated or similar. 
The project I have developed is divided in two main parts: a game and a website. The game covers the CI part with the CircleCI pipeline (which will be the main focus in this report), and the testing and the website is where the CD happens, as the new versions of the game are deployed automatically to the website.
To start with, I decided to work with the game as I want to further develop it and use in in the future. The game is written in Python and the code is hosted in Github, where I updated it as soon as I changed something. I have been working with Visual Studio Code as I find it the easiest IDE to work with. 
The first problem I encountered was when I tried to add/commit/push via the Visual Studio terminal, where I got errors all the time. After consulting with my teacher and failing to fix the error for a while, he noticed that the problem was as simple as working in the wrong directory. That problem never arose again and I have been getting way more confident since then about working directly with Github (even after the version control course that we took I did not feel like I could do that without thinking a lot). 
When it comes to writing tests, the main issue was that the game being text-based, 99% of the functions are plain “return”/”print” functions. After some research I found that one can write unit testing for those via the unittest.mock function, so that is what I wrote and it worked, so I did not think much more about that. I shall dive a bit deeper into testing in the future as I reckon it is an area I am definitely not proficient or even good at except for the basic arithmetic function testing. 
Testing (in this case, unit testing) works by checking that single chunks of code, functions, work properly. This is useful when the code is in constant development, as it may make something crash and testing might help you locate the error or occasional bugs and fix them.
I used Flake8 as the linter in the game but being so full of flavour text in big chunks and having “special characters” like in the title, the linter was never happy, but I acknowledge it as a useful tool for code that might be more “regular” in style. When I used the linter in the website part of the code it had no problem in passing (after I fixed a few extra/missing white lines and the such).
When it comes to the CircleCI pipeline, it was fairly easy to create once I understood what every command was. Still, I had some problems when it comes to making it work, as it gave me error all the time. I finally realised there was an extra space in the yml file. When I found it and fixed it, the pipeline had no problems in running. 
In order to achieve CD, what is missing is, as its name shows, the continuous part of the deal. With the linter, testing and circleci pipeline we have achieved a good state of continuous integration and development, but the deployment part is missing. That will be solved in the second part of the assignment.
